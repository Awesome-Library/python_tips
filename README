This repository is mostly concerned with python tips and tricks. 
These are focused on scientific/astronomical uses of Python, with numpy, scipy and matplotlib.
Most of the content lives on the wiki, with some bits of code in the repository when useful.
Mainly for my own reference, but hopefully you can find something useful.
